# webdriverwrapper2
Better interface for Webdriver(Selenium).
Currently only works for Chrome.

The project is referenced in https://github.com/horejsek/python-webdriverwrapper.

But the python-webdriverwrapper only support Selenium3. 

In order to support selenium4, I extracted some methods commonly used in my daily work, so I have a beggar's version of webdriverwrapper2.

This is just for my own use, please support the original author.
